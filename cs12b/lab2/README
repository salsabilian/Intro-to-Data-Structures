README

Holds a table of contents for lab 2 and any special instructions for compiling.



Table of Contents:
-FileReverse.java
-README
-Makefile



Please note: I used example reverse.java from Patrick Tantalo and helped Noah House by giving him the general idea for what lab 2 should look like, we never looked at each others code
and never spoke in larger than general ideas or pseudocode in discussing the project.
